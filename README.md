<!-- PROJECT SHIELDS -->
<!--
*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
People manually save the published exchange rates from Maybank for purposes such as order invoicing involving foreign currency.
<br />
I tried to automate this process, so that we don't miss any day. And the person in charge to download the rate everyday, can focus on other value creation.

## Future plan
- sort rates in folders, year, month
- Action re-run in few hours in case of no update on the site
